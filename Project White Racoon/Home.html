        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>Also referred to as internet security awareness, cyber security
           awareness is considered the first and formost step in achieving
           true cyber-security. It refers to how much the end-users know about the
           threats their network via which they exist in the world of internet face,
           the risk they introduce and mitigating security best practices to guide their behaviour.
           Cybersecurity helps protect computer systems from unauthorized use, theft, harm
           et cetera. </p>

        <h3>What is it's need?</h3>
        <p>In computer-network theory, the end-users are deemed the most vulnerable
           and weakest link in a network. Due to this natural yet dangerous aspect
           of networking, it has become very important to be aware of potential threats
           that users face while surfing the internet and sharing important data via
           networks. This would help individuals and organizations secure their place
           on the internet and store and retrieve vital data off of the internet safely.</p>

        <h3 title='Click to find out how to celebrate...'>Celebrating Cybersecurity...</h3>
        <p>Every October since that of 2003, is recognized and observed
           as Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Though it was an initiative undertaken
           by american security agencies, today the cause for which it was started is
           supported in almost every country of the world, including India. Throughout
           the 4 to 5 weeks of October, organizations and individuals train themselves
           in becoming aware of dangers of cyberthreats and how to carefully evade them.</p>

        <h3>What danger does cybercrime pose?</h3>
        <p>Cybercrime is the use of a computer to indulge or take part in
           illegal activity like, but not limited to, fraud, identity theft and privacy
           violation et cetera. With an increasing number of cybercrimes being committed
           every year, the risk of not educating yourself on cybersecurity continues to grow.
           While it is impossible to classify every crime committed on the internet
           coherently, they can boil down to:</p>

        <dl>

           <dt>Theft of data</dt>
           <dd>Stealing data from unauthorized places such as personal photos from phones
               or military secrets from government computers</dd>

           <dt>Vandalism</dt>
           <dd>Destroying vital records in banks or personal data off of computers</dd>

           <dt>Fraud</dt>
           <dd>Usually involves channeling funds through unfair ways</dd>

           <dt>Invasion of privacy</dt>
           <dd>Illegalling entering protected personal, financial or medical databases
               and gathering information.</dd>

        <h3>What's your idea of a password?</h3>
        <p>Over these few decades of the internet's existence, it has grown to become an inseparable part of our lives, with much of your
           daily activities being carried out online. But creating accounts that are well-protected via some key beknowsnt only to you and very rarely,
           to people closest to you, is the most common way to be #CyberSafe. This can be achieved by using passwords, biometric locks et cetera. Yet, many people
           carelessly create simple, memorable passwords for granting access which may seem okay but is very risky in the bigger picture. Check out our
           password checker which will help you analyse your passcode and tell you whether it's crackable or damn right impossible to break!!!</p>
