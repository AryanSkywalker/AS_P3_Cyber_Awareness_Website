        <h3>Tips for creating a strong password</h3>
        <dl>

          <dt>Never use personal information</dt>
          <dd>Strong passwords shouldn’t include references to personal information such as  names, birthdays, addresses, or phone numbers.</dd>

          <dt>Include a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols</dt>
          <dd>Secure  passwords include a variety of random characters, numbers, and letters to make the password more complex.</dd>

          <dt>Prioritize password length</dt>
          <dd>Safe passwords should be at least 16 characters long to lessen the chances of falling victim to a data breach or cyberattack. </dd>

          <dt>Never repeat passwords</dt>
          <dd>Reusing the same password for different accounts puts you at risk of credential stuffing attacks frequently used by cybercriminals.</dd>

          <dt>Avoid using real words</dt>
          <dd>Hackers use malicious programs that can process every word found in a dictionary to crack passwords. Stay away from using proper nouns and other standalone dictionary words that could lead to an unsecure password.</dd>

        <h3>Common Misconceptions</h3>
        <p>Replacing letters with digits and symbols. This technique is well known to hackers so swapping an “E” for a “3” or a “5” for a “$” doesn’t make you much more secure.</p>
        <p>That it’s fine to use the same password a lot as long as it’s strong – what if the website is hacked?</p>
      </div>

      <div class='info left reveal'>
        <h3>What does a strong password really looks like?</h3>
        <p>A strong password is one that’s either not easily guessed or not easily brute forced. To make it not easily guessed it can’t be a simple word, to make it not easily cracked it needs to be long and complex. Super computers can go through billions of attempts per second to guess a password. Try to make your passwords a minimum of 14 characters.</p>
      </div>

      <div class='info right reveal'>
        <h3>Try a passphrase</h3>
        <p>A passphrase is simply a password, that’s longer, it could be a sentence, with spaces and punctuation in it. The benefit of a passphrase is that typically they’re easier to remember, but more difficult to crack due to their length. For every additional character in the length of a password or passphrase, the time it would take to break increases exponentially. Ultimately that means that having a long password or passphrase can make you far more secure than having a short one with some symbols or numbers in it.</p>
